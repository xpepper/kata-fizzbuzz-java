FizzBuzz

Refactor this code to make it easier to implement new "Buzz-Words".

First, find out which of the SOLID-principles were violated. 
Then refactor the existing code and make sure the program still behaves the same way after your refactoring. 
There's a unit test in place that checks that on a very rudimentary level.

When you're done refactoring, test the quality of your refactoring by implementing new stuff:



Implement two new "Buzz-Words":

* "Foo"
 - comes always first
 - comes only if the number is a multiple of 6 or 7

* "Bar"
 - comes in between "Fizz" and "Buzz"
 - comes if the number has the digit 3 in it

Evaluate whether or not your refactoring made life easier for you.

Ultimate goal:
For adding yet another "Buzz-Word" no existing code should need to change!
(Except special places like Factories or Construction/Wiring-Methods)
